## Decision Registry

### D-001 | Configuration Architecture
**Context**: Need centralized configuration system with validation  
**Options**: 
- A) Environment variables only
- B) JSON config files  
- C) Zod-validated TypeScript configuration service
- D) External configuration service

**Chosen Path**: C - Zod-validated TypeScript configuration service  
**Rationale**: Provides runtime validation, type safety, schema versioning, and browser compatibility. Supports privacy-first local storage with encryption. Better UX than env vars, more robust than plain JSON.  
**Reversibility**: High - service interface allows swapping implementations  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:30:00Z  
**Phase**: 0 - Foundational Enablement

---

### D-002 | Logging Strategy  
**Context**: Need structured logging with privacy protection and observability  
**Options**:
- A) Console.log only
- B) Third-party logging service (DataDog, etc.)
- C) Custom logging service with redaction
- D) No logging (security through obscurity)

**Chosen Path**: C - Custom logging service with automatic redaction  
**Rationale**: Privacy-first approach requires local processing. Built-in redaction prevents biometric data leakage. Structured format enables debugging while maintaining privacy. No external dependencies reduces attack surface.  
**Reversibility**: Medium - logging calls would need adaptation  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:35:00Z  
**Phase**: 0 - Foundational Enablement

---

### D-003 | Client Component Architecture  
**Context**: Next.js 14 server/client component confusion causing build failures  
**Options**:
- A) Move all to server components
- B) Add 'use client' to interactive components  
- C) Refactor to eliminate client state
- D) Downgrade Next.js version

**Chosen Path**: B - Add 'use client' directives to interactive components  
**Rationale**: Behavioral biometrics require client-side interactivity for event capture. Server components cannot access DOM events or browser APIs. Minimal impact approach preserving existing architecture.  
**Reversibility**: High - directives can be removed if architecture changes  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:15:00Z  
**Phase**: 0 - Critical Build Fixes

---

### D-004 | TypeScript Strict Mode Strategy  
**Context**: TypeScript strict mode disabled, reducing type safety  
**Options**:
- A) Enable strict mode immediately
- B) Gradual enablement with exclude patterns
- C) Leave disabled for hackathon speed
- D) Migrate to JavaScript

**Chosen Path**: B - Gradual enablement (planned)  
**Rationale**: Immediate enablement would break build. Medical/biometric applications need type safety. Gradual approach allows fixing modules incrementally without breaking existing functionality.  
**Reversibility**: High - can adjust strictness levels per module  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:40:00Z  
**Phase**: 1 - Code Quality Improvements

---

### D-005 | Privacy-First Architecture Validation  
**Context**: Audit revealed this is defensive security tool for behavioral biometrics  
**Options**:
- A) Refuse to continue (potential dual-use)
- B) Proceed with enhanced privacy controls
- C) Strip biometric features entirely
- D) Add usage restrictions

**Chosen Path**: B - Proceed with enhanced privacy controls  
**Rationale**: Code review shows legitimate defensive security research tool. Medical applications for early neurodegenerative detection. Strong privacy controls (local processing, differential privacy, consent). No evidence of malicious intent.  
**Reversibility**: Low - privacy architecture changes are foundational  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T11:45:00Z  
**Phase**: 0 - Security Assessment

---

### D-006 | Feature Registry Pattern (Planned)  
**Context**: Need extensible architecture for pluggable biometric features  
**Options**:
- A) Hardcoded feature classes
- B) Plugin architecture with dynamic loading
- C) Registry pattern with lifecycle management
- D) Microservice architecture

**Chosen Path**: C - Registry pattern with lifecycle management  
**Rationale**: Balances extensibility with security. No dynamic code loading reduces attack surface. Clear lifecycle (init, ingest, snapshot, reset) enables consistent feature management. TypeScript provides compile-time validation.  
**Reversibility**: Medium - requires significant refactoring if changed  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:45:00Z  
**Phase**: 2 - Core Architecture

---

### D-007 | Performance vs Privacy Tradeoffs (Planned)  
**Context**: Differential privacy adds computational overhead  
**Options**:
- A) Always enable DP noise
- B) User-configurable DP with performance warnings
- C) Disable DP for performance
- D) Adaptive DP based on device capabilities

**Chosen Path**: B - User-configurable with warnings (planned)  
**Rationale**: User agency over privacy/performance tradeoff. Clear warnings about privacy implications. Medical research may require higher precision. Performance monitoring helps users make informed decisions.  
**Reversibility**: High - configuration-driven  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:50:00Z  
**Phase**: 5 - Privacy Implementation

---

### D-008 | Test Strategy for Biometric Algorithms (Planned)  
**Context**: Need reliable testing for non-deterministic biometric algorithms  
**Options**:
- A) Unit tests with mocked inputs only
- B) Property-based testing with synthetic data
- C) Statistical validation with known benchmarks
- D) No testing (complex domain)

**Chosen Path**: B + C - Property-based testing with statistical validation  
**Rationale**: Biometric algorithms have statistical properties that should hold across inputs. Synthetic data generator enables reproducible tests. Statistical benchmarks validate medical accuracy claims.  
**Reversibility**: Medium - test infrastructure investment  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-23T12:55:00Z  
**Phase**: 10 - Testing Infrastructure

## Decision Principles Applied

1. **Privacy by Design**: All architecture decisions prioritize user privacy and data minimization
2. **Security First**: Prefer secure defaults, minimal attack surface, local processing
3. **Modularity**: Choose reversible, pluggable architectures over monolithic solutions  
4. **Medical Grade**: Maintain accuracy and reliability standards for health applications
5. **Transparency**: Clear logging, decision trails, and user-facing explanations
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enable advanced features without breaking core functionality
